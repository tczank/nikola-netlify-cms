# postcast plugin for Nikola

Generates podcast/netcast RSS feeds from posts. It is originally based
on the speechsynthesizednetcast copyright © 2013–2014 Daniel
Aleksandersen and others.

**LIVE DEMO:** https://civilfritz.net/casts/gameolder.xml


## Why use this plugin?

Nikola is, among other things, a site generator capable of creating
aggregation feeds from a collection of posts. These posts can be
associated with metadata. By adding `enclosure` and other metadata to
a post, these posts effectively become entries in a podcast-style rss
feed suitable for publication with popular podcast platforms and
subscription by popular podcast applications.


## Usage

- `casts` directory is the location in `output` where your cast feeds
  will be generated. You can change this by setting `POSTCAST_PATH`.

      POSTCAST_PATH = 'casts'

- By default, no postcast feeds are generated; one feed will be
  generated for each entry in the `POSTCASTS` list.

      POSTCASTS = ['mycast']

- Each cast feed can be associated with a Nikola category. Only posts
  in that category will be incorporated into the feed.

      POSTCAST_CATEGORY = {
          'mycast': 'cat_mycast',
      }

- Each cast feed can further (or in stead) be associated with a list
  of tags. Only posts with *all* of the tags in the list will be
  incorporated into the feed.

      POSTCAST_TAGS = {
          'mycast': ['mycast-episode'],
      }

Other configuration options are available. For more information, see
`conf.py.sample`.
